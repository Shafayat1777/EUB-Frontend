        The Department of Accounting and Finance at North South University is a
        CFA University Affiliation Program Partner of the CFA Institute, a
        global membership organization that awards the Chartered Financial
        Analyst® (CFA®) designation. As such, the Finance Major of the
        bachelor’s degree awarded by North South University covers a significant
        portion (at least 70%) of the CFA Program Candidate Body of Knowledge.
        Recognition as a CFA Institute Affiliated University signals to
        students, employers, and the marketplace that North South University’s
        curriculum is closely tied to professional practice and is well-suited
        to preparing students to sit for the CFA examinations. It is widely
        considered the investment profession’s most rigorous credentialing
        program. CFA Student Scholarships: The Department of Accounting and
        Finance at North South University offers a limited number of
        scholarships on a yearly basis. This awareness scholarship waives
        registration fees and a portion of the enrollment fee for the CFA Level
        1 exam. Eligible students are highly encouraged to apply for a
        scholarship throughout the Academic Year. For more information,
        interested students are invited to contact the chair of the Department
