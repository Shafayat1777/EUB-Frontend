        Tourism is the largest industry in the world today. According to UNWTO
        statistics, international tourist arrivals reached 940 million in 2010,
        generating $923 billion in foreign earnings. Often referred to as the
        &quot;master key&quot; of the global economy, tourism integrates 109
        sectors and creates one job every 2.5 seconds. Over 300 million people
        are directly employed in this industry, with one in every eight workers
        belonging to this sector. As tourism continues to expand, it will shape
        lifestyles and enhance economic growth throughout the 21st century.

        The primary objective of the Bachelor&apos;s program in Tourism &
        Hospitality Management at the European University of Bangladesh (EUB) is
        to develop skilled professionals capable of meeting the growing global
        demand in the tourism sector. As a labor-intensive and highly profitable
        industry, tourism requires trained personnel for both public and private
        enterprises. In response, EUB offers a four-year professional degree
        focusing on hotel operations, management practices, and hands-on
        training, including local and international internships. The program is
        led by experienced faculty and industry experts who provide students
        with academic knowledge and professional guidance.
