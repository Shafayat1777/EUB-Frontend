        Law plays a vital role in almost every aspect of modern life, making the
        study of law and the preparation of competent legal professionals
        increasingly challenging. Recognizing this need, the European University
        of Bangladesh (EUB) offers high-quality legal studies programs to equip
        students with the necessary knowledge and skills. The university
        provides a four-year Bachelor of Laws (LL.B. Hons.), a two-year Bachelor
        of Laws (LL.B. Pass), and a two-year Master of Laws (LL.M.) program,
        which includes a one-year LL.M. (Preliminary) and a one-year LL.M.
        (Final).

        To enhance practical learning, the department plans to establish a Moot
        Court, allowing students to engage in simulated legal proceedings and
        gain hands-on experience in trial advocacy within a courtroom setting.
        The primary objective of the Department of Law is to produce
        well-trained law graduates with a strong understanding of legal
        principles. Additionally, the postgraduate program is designed to
        provide in-depth knowledge, research opportunities, and insights into
        emerging legal developments in the 21st century, ensuring that graduates
        remain well-prepared for dynamic legal challenges.
