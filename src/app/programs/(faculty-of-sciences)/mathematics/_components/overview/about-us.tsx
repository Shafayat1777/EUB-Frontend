        <strong>
          Welcome to the Department of Mathematics at the European University of
          Bangladesh (EUB).
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Mathematics, though difficult to trace to a precise point of origin, has
        been an essential tool for human development since the dawn of
        civilization. From measuring land and tracking time to solving complex
        engineering problems, mathematics has been embedded in our lives in both
        simple and sophisticated ways. While its early uses were practical,
        mathematics as a formal academic discipline is relatively modern. In
        today’s world, its relevance and utility continue to expand rapidly,
        finding new applications in diverse fields across the globe.
        <br />
        <br />
        At EUB, our Mathematics Department reflects the dynamic and evolving
        nature of the subject. We are a vibrant academic community of scholars
        united by a shared commitment to excellence in teaching and research.
        Like other distinguished departments within the university, we strive to
        foster a learning environment that emphasizes intellectual rigor,
        creative inquiry, and academic achievement. Our department offers a wide
        range of mathematics courses across all departments within the Faculty
        of Science and Engineering, ensuring a solid mathematical foundation for
        students of various disciplines.
        <br />
        <br />
        We are proud to house a state-of-the-art research lab that encourages
        innovation and exploration. This facility serves as a central hub for
        students and faculty to collaborate on advanced mathematical research
        and problem-solving. Our highly qualified faculty members are not only
        experienced educators but also active contributors to national and
        international research communities. Their dedication ensures that
        students receive both a strong theoretical grounding and exposure to
        cutting-edge developments in mathematics.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beyond classroom instruction, our department promotes a culture of
        engagement through seminars, workshops, and student-led research
        initiatives. These opportunities allow students to deepen their
        understanding, connect with peers, and present their work in academic
        settings. It’s a place where ideas flourish and curiosity is celebrated.
        <br />
        <br />
        We invite prospective students to become part of this exciting journey.
        Join us at the Mathematics Department of EUB, where learning extends
        beyond textbooks and where the elegance of mathematics inspires
        discovery and innovation. Together, let’s shape the future through the
        power of numbers and logic.
