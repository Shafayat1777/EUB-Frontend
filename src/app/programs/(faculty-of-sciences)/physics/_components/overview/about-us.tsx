        <strong>
          Welcome to the Department of Physics at the European University of
          Bangladesh (EUB)
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Department of Physics at EUB provides an exceptional environment for
        advancing physics education and research. Renowned for its dynamic
        involvement in scientific inquiry, the department stands as a hub of
        academic excellence within the university. Our distinguished faculty
        members are recognized globally for their expertise in both teaching and
        research, contributing to a vibrant and inspiring academic community.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently, the department comprises four dedicated faculty members, each
        committed to delivering high-quality undergraduate education and leading
        innovative research. We offer a robust curriculum tailored to
        engineering students, ensuring a solid foundation in fundamental
        physical principles. Our course offerings encompass essential areas such
        as electricity, electromagnetism, properties of matter, classical
        mechanics, quantum mechanics, waves and oscillations, and
        thermodynamicsâ€”providing students with a comprehensive understanding of
        modern physics.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition, we delve into advanced and emerging fields, including
        condensed matter physics, materials science, nanophysics, optical
        physics, and computational physics. These areas prepare students to
        engage with next-generation technologies and scientific breakthroughs.
        <br />
        <br />
        The department also fosters interdisciplinary research through active
        collaboration with other academic units, including Chemistry, Electrical
        and Electronic Engineering, Civil Engineering, Textile Engineering,
        Industrial Production Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. These
        partnerships promote innovation across disciplines, leading to
        pioneering advancements that address real-world challenges.
        <br />
        <br />
        Looking ahead, the Department of Physics aspires to be one of the
        foremost centers for physics education and research in Bangladesh. We
        are committed to nurturing a dynamic, collaborative atmosphere where
        passionate faculty, driven students, and dedicated staff work together
        to achieve academic and scientific excellence. Our mission is to equip
        future engineers and global leaders with the knowledge and skills needed
        to confront the challenges of tomorrow.
