            Through hands-on experiments in this Physics Lab, students will
            develop a solid understanding of core concepts in mechanics, optics,
            electromagnetism, and materials science. They will acquire practical
            skills in utilizing a range of experimental techniques and
            measurement instruments, effectively bridging theoretical knowledge
            with real-world applications.
            <br />
            <br />
            The lab experience emphasizes precision in measurement,
            comprehensive error analysis, and thoughtful data interpretation.
            Students will also refine their ability to systematically document
            procedures, critically evaluate results, and present their findings
            through clear, well-structured lab reports. These experiences will
            strengthen both their problem-solving capabilities and scientific
            communication skills, laying a strong foundation for advanced
            studies in physics and related disciplines.
