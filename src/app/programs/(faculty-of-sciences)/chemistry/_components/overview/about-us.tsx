          Welcome to the Department of Chemistry at the European University of
          Bangladesh (EUB)
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Department of Chemistry at EUB offers an exemplary environment for
        advancing chemical education and research. Known for its active
        contribution to the universityâ€™s academic landscape, the department is
        home to faculty members who are internationally recognized for their
        excellence in both teaching and research.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently, the department comprises five dedicated faculty members who
        are actively engaged in undergraduate instruction and lead vibrant
        research programs. Our curriculum is designed to support undergraduate
        engineering students, providing a strong foundation in core areas of
        chemistry, including inorganic, organic, analytical, and physical
        chemistry.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beyond the fundamentals, our program also introduces students to
        advanced and specialized topics such as environmental chemistry, surface
        and materials chemistry, nanoscience, polymer chemistry, and
        organometallic chemistry. These areas reflect the evolving nature of the
        discipline and prepare students to contribute to emerging scientific
        challenges.
        <br />
        <br />
        The department encourages interdisciplinary collaboration through
        research partnerships with other academic units, including Physics,
        Civil Engineering, Textile Engineering, Industrial Production
        Engineering, and Electrical and Electronic Engineering. These alliances
        promote innovation and enable the development of solutions to complex,
        real-world problems.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Department of Chemistry at EUB is committed to becoming one of the
        leading chemistry departments in Bangladesh. We cultivate a
        collaborative academic environment enriched by passionate faculty,
        dedicated colleagues, motivated students, and skilled staff. Our mission
        is to prepare future engineers and global citizens with the knowledge
        and skills needed to address the environmental and technological
        challenges of tomorrow.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thank you for visiting the Department of Chemistry at EUB. We invite you
        to explore our programs, research, and academic opportunities.
