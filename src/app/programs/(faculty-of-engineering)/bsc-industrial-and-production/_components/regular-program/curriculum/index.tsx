        The undergraduate students of different years of the Department of
        Computer Science and Engineering have to follow the course schedule
        given below.

        <h6 className='text-lg font-semibold'>Course Types</h6>
        <p className='mt-1'>
          The courses included in the undergraduate curriculam are divided into
          the following groups:
        </p>
        <ul className='mt-2 list-disc space-y-4 pl-6'>
          <li>
            <h6 className='font-semibold'>Core Courses</h6>
            <p className='mt-1'>
              In CSE discipline, a number of courses are identified as core
              courses, which form the nucleus of the respective bachelorâ€™s
              degree program. A student has to complete the entire designated
              core courses of his/her discipline.

          <li>
            <h6 className='font-semibold'>Prerequisite Courses</h6>
            <p className='mt-1'>
              Some of the core courses are identified as prerequisite courses
              for a specific subject. A prerequisite course is one, which is
              required to be completed before some other course(s) can be taken.
            </p>

            <h6 className='font-semibold'>Elective Courses</h6>
            <p className='mt-1'>
              Apart from the core courses, the students can choose courses from
              a set of elective courses. Elective courses are divided into
              computer science, software engineering, communication technology
              and computer engineering

        <h6 className='text-lg font-semibold'>Course Category</h6>
        <p className='mt-1'>
          The letter prefix in any course number indicates the
          discipline/subject offering the course.
          <br />
          Letter symbols for course categories are:

        <h6 className='text-lg font-semibold'>Numbering System</h6>
        <p className='mt-1'>
          Each course is designated by a maximum of four letter code identifying
          the department offering the course followed by a three-digit number
          having the following interpretation:
        </p>

        <ul className='mt-2 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6'>
          <li>
            The first digit corresponds to the year/level in which the course is
            normally taken by the students.
          </li>
          <li>
            The second digit is reserved for departmental use. It usually
            identifies a specific area/group of study within the department.
          </li>
          <li>
            The last digit is an odd number for theoretical courses and an even
            number for sessional courses.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className='mt-4'>
          The course designation system is illustrated by the following example.

        <h6 className='text-lg font-semibold'>Credits Assignment</h6>
        <p className='mt-1'>
          The assignment of credits to theoretical course is different from that
          of laboratory course, which is stated as follows:
        </p>

        <ul className='mt-2 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6'>
          <li>
            For theoretical courses one lecture per week per term is equivalent
            to one credit.
          </li>
          <li>
            For laboratory courses two class hours per week per term is
            equivalent to one credit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Credits are also assigned to project work taken by the students. The
            amount of credits assigned to such work may vary from one discipline
            to another.
