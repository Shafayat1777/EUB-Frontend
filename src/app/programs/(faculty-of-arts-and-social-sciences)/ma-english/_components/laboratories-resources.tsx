						The Electrical Circuits Laboratory is one of the introductory labs in our university
						that comprises of DC Circuit Laboratory and AC Circuit Laboratory. For DC Circuit Lab,
						we familiarize the students with different types of circuit and network theorems. We use
						sophisticated DC power supply, Digital Multi Meter, LCR Meter, Trainer Board to
						implement these theorems. In addition, we also use different values of resistors and
						other circuitry components. For the AC circuit Laboratory, students are introduced with
						rectifiers, voltage stabilization and various tuning circuits to comprehend and to
						visualize the real life scenarios. To do so, we provide the students with well-furnished
						lab consisting of Oscilloscopes, Signal Generators,Function Generators etc. For the
						advanced level students we introduce them with more complex circuits like wave
						generators, resonance. We believe that students are benefited from these laboratory
						sessions as part of their coursework.

						The Electronics-I lab is designed to give the students with a practical experience
						working with applications of operational amplifier, diodes and transistors (BJT, FETs
						and MOSFETs). The laboratory is complemented in support with the theory taught in the
						lectures in order to help the students apply their knowledge of electronics in
						engineering. The labs also reinforce the concepts discussed in class with a hands-on
						approach and allow the students to gain significant experience with electrical
						instruments such as function generators, digital multimeters, oscilloscopes, and power
						supplies.

						The experiments in Communication Electronics lab is designed to introduce various
						aspects of analog electronics starting from the simplest concepts leading to practical
						electronic circuits including amplifiers, integrated circuits, oscillators and voltage
						regulators. Each workstation in the lab has the necessary equipment: an oscilloscope, a
						function (signal) generator, a digital multimeter and an experimental box. The
						independent variable power supply includes a robust current limiting control for
						supplying power to the circuits.

						The Digital Electronics lab is designed such that the students get a hand on familiarity
						with the concepts they come across in the Digital Electronics course. This course deals
						with the basics of digital systems design and is a core module of the B. Sc. Electrical
						Engineering coursework as it provides the prerequisites for advance courses in digital
						electronics. Because of the signiï¬cance of this course the Lab has been carefully
						designed to meet the course requirement. The Lab is well equipped with both hardware and
						software facilities required by the students to perform the necessary experiments
						designed for this lab. Experiments are designed in such a way that the students become
						well aware of the concepts they learn in the theory sessions.

					Electrical Transmission and Distribution Systems Laboratory
				</h4>
				<div className='mt-2'>
					<p className='text-justify'>
						This laboratory, enriched with Lab-Volt machineries and equipment is devoted to
						developing a practical understanding of the transmission line link a subject which is
						usually taught in a strictly theoretical way. The experiments show how changes in the
						source, the load, and the transmission line affect the overall performance of the
						system. In particular, they illustrate the meaning of real and reactive power, how the
						voltage at the end of a line can be lowered or raised, how power can be forced to flow
						over one line instead of another, how generators can be synchronized and how a system
						behaves when subjected to disturbances. Despite their small size, the employed
						economical, low-power, and safe electric alternators, motors, capacitors, reactors,
						resistors, meters, transformers, and transmission lines are designed to act in exactly
						the same way under steady-state and transient conditions, as their larger counter parts
						in industry. This practical, hands-on course is presented in a way that is readily
						understandable by anyone who has knowledge of electricity at the technical school.
