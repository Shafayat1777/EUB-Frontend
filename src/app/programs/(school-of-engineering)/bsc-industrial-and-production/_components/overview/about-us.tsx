        The Industrial & Production Engineering (IPE) program at the European
        University of Bangladesh (EUB) is designed to equip students with the
        technical expertise and problem-solving skills needed to optimize
        industrial processes and enhance productivity. As industries in
        Bangladesh continue to expand, the demand for skilled engineers in
        manufacturing, supply chain management, and automation is increasing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our four-year undergraduate program offers a comprehensive curriculum
        covering manufacturing systems, operations research, quality control,
        supply chain management, and industrial automation. Through a
        combination of theoretical knowledge and hands-on training in
        state-of-the-art laboratories, students gain practical experience to
        tackle real-world challenges in production and process optimization.
        <br />
        <br />
        EUB emphasizes innovation, efficiency, and sustainability, preparing
        graduates for leadership roles in industrial sectors both locally and
        globally. With an industry-oriented approach, research opportunities,
        and experienced faculty, the IPE program ensures students are ready to
        contribute to Bangladeshâ€™s growing industrial landscape and beyond.
