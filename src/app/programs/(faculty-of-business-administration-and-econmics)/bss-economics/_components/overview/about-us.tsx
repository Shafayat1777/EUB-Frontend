        Bangladesh (EUB). Our Bachelor of Social Sciences (BSS) in Economics
        program is designed to provide students with a strong foundation in
        economic theories, policies, and practical applications. Through
        rigorous coursework and hands-on learning, we equip students with
        analytical and quantitative skills essential for careers in economics,

        Our experienced educators and researchers ensure students receive
        up-to-date insights into global economic trends. The program covers
        microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, international trade,

        Economics Club organizes seminars, workshops, and competitions to
        enhance learning beyond the classroom. EUB provides state-of-the-art
