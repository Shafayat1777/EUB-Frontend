          The MSS in Economics is a 51-credit hour program, with credits divided
          into Foundation, Core, and Specialization courses. The Core Courses
          are compulsory for all students. Students must choose 3 courses from
          the Foundation Courses and 2 courses from each specialization group.
          This structure ensures a balanced approach to both general economic
          theory and specialized areas of study. The program is designed to
          provide a comprehensive understanding of economics while allowing
          students to tailor their learning based on their interests and career
          goals.
