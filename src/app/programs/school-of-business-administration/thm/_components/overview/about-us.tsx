        Tourism is the largest industry in the world today. According to the
        United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) statistics,
        international tourist arrivals reached 940 million in 2010, generating
        $923 billion in foreign earnings. Often referred to as the &quot;master
        key&quot; of the global economy, tourism integrates 109 sectors and
        creates one job every 2.5 seconds. Over 300 million people are directly
        employed in this industry, with one in every eight workers belonging to
        this sector. As tourism continues to expand, it will shape lifestyles
        and enhance economic growth throughout the 21st century. Beyond its
        economic impact, tourism fosters cultural exchange, promotes global
        understanding, and drives innovation in sustainability and technology.
        The Bachelor’s program in Tourism and Hospitality Management at the
        European University of Bangladesh (EUB) is designed to prepare competent
        professionals to meet the growing global demand in the tourism and
        hospitality sectors. As a dynamic and labor-intensive industry, tourism
        requires a highly skilled workforce to support both public and private
        enterprises. In response, EUB offers a comprehensive four-year
        professional program that emphasizes hotel operations, management
        strategies, and practical learning experiences. Students benefit from
        hands-on training, including internship opportunities that foster
        real-world skills. The program is guided by a team of experienced
        faculty members and industry professionals who provide academic
        expertise and valuable insights to help students thrive in their future
        careers. Graduates of this program are recognized worldwide as skilled
        professionals in tourism and hospitality. Career opportunities include
        roles in tourism management, hotel operations, travel agencies,
        airlines, and event planning. Additionally, graduates can pursue careers
        as hotel and resort managers, tour operators, travel consultants,
        conference managers, or even entrepreneurs in the hospitality industry.
        With a strong foundation in both theory and practice, graduates are
        equipped to adapt to the industry’s evolving demands and make meaningful
        contributions to its growth. At EUB, we don’t just educate—we inspire
